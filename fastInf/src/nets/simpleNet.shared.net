#The option to add idle or shared params

#where you wish to fix some entries in a table during learning
#or tie some entries in the table to the same parameter
#to see example for usage see simpleNet.shared.net in this directory.

# the table is ordered when the assign advances like a number i.e : 000 001 010 011 100 ...
# In this case, the usage of shared/idle parameters is demonstrated.
# This settings determine that the first parameter in meas0 will be set
# to 1 (i.e., will have no effect on the likelihood) and its value
# won't be changed during learning. The two middle parameters
# in meas1 (corresponding to assingments (0,1) and (1,0) will be
# tied to each other duting learning (i.e., their gradient
# will be calculated as the some of gradients for each parameter).
