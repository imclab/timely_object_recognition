Installing FastInf
=======================

1) Go to fastInf/src and type: 
   > make externalLibs 
   This command will download the GSL and GLPK libraries from their corresponding ftp sites
   and install them on your computer. If you want to download the libraries yourself or already 
   have them on your computer, follow the instructions in the bottom of this page.
   * Note: the compilation of GSL and GLPK can take some time.
 
2) Go to the fastInf/src and type:
   > make  

3) After compilation you will find all the executables under the fastInf/build directory.
   To make sure the compilation succeeded, you can run fastInf/build/bin/infer 
   with no parameters (it will result in the usage message). 
   In case of linkage problems with GSL see comment below.    


Possible problems with linkage to GSL
===================================

If the library compiles properly, but during runtime a linkage error 
occurs, there might be linking problems to the GSL library.
To solve standard library linking problems (.so flies) you need to update your LD_LIBRARY_PATH; For example: 
> setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH [ROOT GSL DIR/.libs]:[ROOT GSL DIR/cblas/.libs]:[ROOT GLPK DIR/build/lib]

If there dynamic linking problems (.dylib files) you should update your 
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH; For example:
> setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH [ROOT GSL DIR/.libs]:[ROOT GSL DIR/cblas/.libs]:[ROOT GLPK DIR/build/lib]



Running Examples
================
You can run these commands from the fastInf root directory:

Run simple lbp and print final beliefs (on cliques):
build/bin/infer -i src/nets/simpleNetWithLoop -b 0

Run lbp with weighted queue scheduling and print final beliefs:
build/bin/infer -i src/nets/simpleNetWithLoop -q 1 -b 0

Run lbp, compute also exact beliefs using clique tree and compare the beliefs:
build/bin/infer -i src/nets/simpleNetWithLoop -exact + -b 0

Run lbp, assign the evidence in the grid3x3.assign file and compute log likelihood of each assignment:
build/bin/infer -i src/nets/grid3x3.net -e src/nets/grid3x3.assign -m 0

Run generalized lbp, and compute marginals (for each variable):
build/bin/infer -i src/nets/grid3x3.net -c src/nets/grid3x3.clusters -b 0

Run Mean Field infernce and print beliefs:
build/bin/mfinfer -i src/nets/simpleloop.net -b 0

Run standard Gibbs Sampling to sample 500 samples from grid9x9:
build/bin/gibbsSample src/nets/grid9x9.net 10000 1000 500 gibbsData_9x9grid.assign

Run Gibbs Sampling with burning time decided by convergence test (but no larger than 10000) to sample 500 samples from grid3x3:
build/bin/gibbsSample src/nets/grid3x3.net converge:10000 1000 500 gibbsData_3x3grid.assign

Run Gibbs Sampling on 6 chains with varying temperatures (with annealing) to sample 500 samples from grid9x9:
build/bin/gibbsSample src/nets/grid9x9.net 10000 1000 500 gibbsData_9x9grid.assign -anneal=6

Learn the parameters of the alarm network from the 100 data samples in alarm.100.fastInf.data:
build/bin/learning -i src/nets/alarm/alarm.fastInf.net -e src/nets/alarm/alarm.100.fastInf.data -o alarmResultNet.net

Learn the parameters of the alarm network as above with L1 regulariation (param 0.5):
build/bin/learning -i src/nets/alarm/alarm.fastInf.net -e src/nets/alarm/alarm.100.fastInf.data -r1 0.5 -o alarmResultNet.net

Learn the parameters of the alarm network as above with L2 regulariation (param 0.7):
build/bin/learning -i src/nets/alarm/alarm.fastInf.net -e src/nets/alarm/alarm.100.fastInf.data -r2 0.7 -o alarmResultNet.net




Installing GSL and GLPK
====================================

* In case you already have downloaded and installed GSL and GLPK go directly to section (3).

1) Download the GSL library from its website (you can use version 1.11 from here:
   http://ftp.cc.uoc.gr/mirrors/gnu/gsl/gsl-1.11.tar.gz). After unzipping it, 
   you need to compile it by going to its root directory, and use ./configure followed by
   make (see GSL README for specific instructions)

2) Download the GLPK library from its website (you can use version 4.41 from here:
   http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/glpk/glpk-4.41.tar.gz). After unzipping it, 
   you need to compile it from its root directory. To simplify the installations process, 
   we recommend to create a build directory inside the glpk home dir, and then use 
   ./configure --prefix=[full target directory], followed by make and make install. (see 
   glpk README and INSTALL documentation files, or type ./configure --help).
   For example, if your glpk-home-dir is /Users/username/glpk use:
   > cd /Users/username/glpk
   > mkdir build
   > ./configure --prefix=/Users/username/glpk/build
   > make 
   > make install   

3) In fastInf/src open the file Makefile.libraries, and update the location of the libraries you 
   compiled in sections 1-2
