# Timely Object Recognition

A system for deploying object detectors in sequence, guided by a policy that takes into account the current "belief state" of the system.
The policy is learned using reinforcement learning techniques.

Configured to use pre-output DPM [1] detections and pre-output GIST features
on the PASCAL VOC dataset.
Relies on the FastInf library [2] for one of the inference modes (code included).

This code accompanies my NIPS 2012 publication on Timely Object Recognition.

For more recent code, see the [project page](http://sergeykarayev.com/recognition-on-a-budget/).
